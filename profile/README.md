# Welcome to Startino!

### Our Mission

Help non-tech founders build their software ideas into a successful software business.

### What We Do

At Startino, we act as a tech co-founder for non-tech founders to help build their software idea. We offer the reliability, conviction, and passion of a co-founder without the risk of partnering with a (random) tech partner online or dealing with development agencies that aren't committed enough, produce generic solutions, and possibly have communication (language or technical) barriers. On the side, we spend our time building our software projects like [Aitino](https://aiti.no).

### Why We Do It

We were inspired to create Futino when we observed that many non-tech founders struggle to build out their software idea in a holistic manner; giving half their business to someone untrustworthy, wasting their time with no-code solutions, or working with a traditional agency that doesn't care about their project. From building and launching our own SaaS, I've learnt that the project is like a baby- and I personally wouldn't trust **just** anyone helping to raise it.

### How We Do It

Our secret sauce lies in harnessing the power of modern technologies and mixing it with... well... actually caring. We take on projects with promising founders that we see a future with and that we're keen on building.
