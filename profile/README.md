# Welcome to Startino!

### Our Mission

Help non-technical industry experts build successful software businesses.

### What We Do

At Startino, we act as a tech co-founder for non-technical industry experts to bring their software idea to life. We offer the reliability, conviction, and passion of a co-founder without the risk of partnering with a (random) tech partner online or dealing with development agencies that aren't committed enough, produce generic solutions, and possibly have communication (language or technical) barriers. On the side, we spend our time building our software projects that you can browse on our Github.

### Why We Do It

We were inspired to create Startino when we observed that many non-tech founders struggle to build out their software idea in a holistic manner; giving half their business to someone untrustworthy, wasting their time with no-code solutions, or working with a freelancer that abandons them mid-way there. From building and launching our own SaaS, we've learnt that a software product is like a baby- and I personally wouldn't trust **just** anyone to help to raise it.

### How We Do It

Our secret sauce lies in harnessing the power of modern technologies and mixing it with... well... actually caring. We take on projects with promising founders reflecting an expertise in the industry that they're proposing starting a business in. We need to see a future with them and be keen on the actual project.
