# Welcome to Futino!

### Our Mission
Leverage the power of modern technologies and open-source software to help non-tech founders actualize their software idea in a holistic manner.
### What We Do
At Futino, we act as a tech co-founder for non-tech founders to help build their software idea. We offer the reliability, conviction, and passion of a co-founder without the risk of partnering with a (random) tech partner online or dealing with development agencies that aren't committed enough, produce generic solutions, and possibly have communication (language or technical) barriers. On the side, we spend our time building our software projects like [Aitino](https://aiti.no).
### Why We Do It
We were inspired to create Futino when we observed that many non-tech founders struggle to build out their software idea in a holistic manner; giving half their business to someone untrustworthy, wasting their time with no-code solutions, or working with a traditional agency that doesn't care about their project. From building and launching our own SaaS, I've learnt that the project is like a baby- and I personally wouldn't trust **just** anyone helping to raise it.
### How We Do It
Our secret sauce lies in harnessing the power of modern technologies and mixing it with... well... actually caring. We take on projects with promising founders that we see a future with and that we're keen on building.
### Our Pricing Model
Our unique pricing model is also what differentiates us. Instead of paying unpredictable & inflated billable hours (also totally determined by the other party), you pay a monthly subscripiton for a fixed amount of work from us. It makes it more of a partnership rather than a provider-client relationship. Scale your subscription on a month to month basis, depending on workload and funds. You can also pause anytime.
## Aitino

Leveraging the power of multi-agent environments and seamless integration with other business systems, Aitino is poised to transform how everyone operates.
